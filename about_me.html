		<h3>Hello to my fellow friends and student from IIT</h3>
           <p>My name is Peter Stanczak and I am a transfer student. After successful graduation with Associate Degree of Information System Security from College of DuPage
		      I am currently seeking a Bachelor Degree of ITM at IIT. I have many interests, which I have no time to pursue at the moment because of my full commitment and total engagement at IIT. 
		      Some of these interests include building RC planes and drone racing. Not many people know that drone racing is becoming a new high speed sport among many computer engineering savvy individuals.
		      Some of these custom built copter-drones exceed speed up to 120 mph! I hope you also find this interesting, please watch the video below.
